				<h1>about me</h2>
				<p>I'm a sophomore majoring in computer engineering. I'm passionate about exploring 
					software and hardware projects whether through my research, clubs, or just in 
					my spare time. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Last summer, I had the incredible opportunity to study abroad in Japan 
					to learn about Japanese culture and enhance my langauge skills. I also was able to explore web programming, 
					UX design, and HTML/CSS, which has led to the creation of this website. 
					<br>
					<br>
					When I'm not immersed in tech, you'll often find me crocheting or learning some new hobby.
