				<p> For this project, I worked on a team of three other people to build a robotic car that responds to loud sounds.
                    As shown in the video, every time someone clapped, the car would reverse directions. 
					<br>
					<br>
					The car itself was made up of a couple different subcomponents: microphone, amplifier, DRAM, and H-bridge.
                    The microphone picked up the audio signal and then we needed an amplifier to amplify the signal since it was very
                    small. The DRAM stored the state of the car and would change it based on if there was a signal from the microphone.
                    Finally the H-Bridge was responsible for controlling the car's motors.
                    <br>
					<br>
                    The main issue we faced is that we had built each subcomponent separately so figuring out how to combine the parts
                    and make it all cohesive was a bit of an issue. We first tried just connecting circuit components together immediately 
                    but that messed up our circuit a lot. A solution that worked was to draw the entire circuit out and then connect the components.
