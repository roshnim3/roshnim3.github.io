				<h1 class = "Title">Battleship Game</h1>
				<h3 class = "Date">July 31st, 2023</h3>
				<p> I coded from scratch a Battleship Game using C++. The purpose of the game was to build on the
                    knowledge I had learned in my Computer Systems Class and advance it into a game that I like. The game
                    itself is Player vs. Computer and is based on the popular board game. 
					<br>
					<br>
					I had two main issues with the game, mostly surrounding the computer side. The first issue was generating
                    a board for the computer to play with that fit the rules of the game. There were so many places ships could
                    not go and I had to create algorithms that simiplified these rules and shortened my code. 
                    <br>
					<br>
                    The second issue was creating an algorithm that made the computer not terrible at the game. My initial algorithm 
                    was complete randomness. After some research, I am developing a new algorithm. If the computer hits a ship, it stores 
                    the points around the coordinate in a list. Then on the next turn it checks those coordinates. It keeps going like this. 
                    This will help the computer be a little smarter with its moves, but not enough where it could beat the player.
                    I am currently researching other algorithms that would help improve the computer's performance.
