				<h1 class = "Title">LED Cube</h1>
				<h3 class = "Date">January 8th, 2023</h3>
				<p> The creation of this cube started off as a honors project for one of my classes. I started the research
                    and initial development during the semester but weren't able to finish it. I ended up taking it home and 
                    finishing it on my own time. The cube is a 6x6x6 cube with 216 LEDs, which I soldered together. 
					<br>
					<br>
					The negative end of each LED is grounded and then I am able to control when an LED turns on by connecting 
                    the postiive end to a microcontroller and send bits across it to light up individual LEDs. The hardest part
                    was 1) learning how the microcontroller works so I can code out the patterns and 2) learning how to solder
                    all of the LEDs.
