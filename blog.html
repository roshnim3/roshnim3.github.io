			<h1 class = "blog-title">My Experience with Generative AI</h1>
			<p class = "blog-content">
				In my technology and management seminar, I attended a dinner centered around the generative AI boom 
				and listened to a lecturer about our progress in the AI field and where the future is headed. As a 
				computer engineer, the advancements being made to make computers rival our knowledge and brain 
				capabilities has long fascinated me and is one of the reasons I chose my major. 
				<br>
				<br>
				One thing the lecturer was talking about was how every time a new revolutionary technology enters the 
				market, many people get worried or excited that computers will soon have the ability to rival human 
				intelligence and the future will forever be changed. One of the earlier examples he gave was when Deep 
				Blue came out in the late 1900s and beat chess champions, people were shocked. However the computer wasn’t 
				really thinking intelligently but probabilistically. It would examine all possible moves and pick the 
				one that had the highest chance of winning, which meant it was taking a lot of computing power. Another 
				example he gave was an algorithm trained on Shakespearen work that would attempt to generate English 
				sentences based on the probability of words being grouped together. The output was something that somewhat 
				resembles Iambic Pentameter. However even then it wasn’t really intelligent or actually understandable. 
				The sentences sounded like English but actually made no sense if you read them.
				<br>
				<br>
				Even ChatGPT isn’t really as intelligent as people may think. When I first watched the videos on how it 
				was able to write code and give ideas for gifts, I was amazed. I could not stop using it. However, I soon 
				realized it really isn’t as smart as I originally thought. Besides the fact that it could not do math, it 
				also struggled to understand when it made a mistake. If there was a line of code that was wrong, it would 
				rarely be able to fix it without a lot of guidance. Everything it outputs is based on something humans have 
				already created. It isn’t able to have unique thoughts but it is just recreating something. For example, 
				if you are asking it to solve a coding problem, it searches for similar coding problems and outputs code 
				based on that. This means it can’t really create something revolutionary new which puts it way behind humans
				on the path of innovation. I’ve talked to a few professors as well on chatGPT and they have all said they use 
				it and find it an incredible tool. However, they also are very wary of the outputs, emphasizing that it still 
				requires human input to refine it. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Another reason I have been interested in this topic is that this past semester I have been consulting with a 
				startup in the generative AI industry whose product is able to take thousands of documents and create a chatGPT 
				LLM centered around those documents. Not only is it able to answer questions based on the document but also 
				cite specific pages. When I first heard about this product a few months ago, I was amazed and thought it would 
				be such a cool tool to have. Especially since my experience with chatGPT is that it often had hallucinations 
				and would make up information. However, within a month or two of joining the project, openAI announced GPT 4 
				Turbo whose capabilities cover what the startup does and more. It was a very interesting project to work on 
				because the news that was being announced daily affected the choices we were making. The market for generative 
				AI is changing so fast which makes it fascinating to keep up with the news. As the technology continues to progress, 
				I am excited about the direction it will take.

			<h1 class = "blog-title"> How I Learned To Give Constructive Feedback </h1>
			<p class = "blog-content">
				I am currently in a technology and management seminar where we get to meet and talk to leaders in the 
				field and learn about how they got to where they are today. One of my favorite weeks was about “how to
				give and receive constructive feedback,” which is something I struggled a lot with. Whenever I had to 
				give feedback for someone’s work or ideas, I always used a compliment sandwich. I would tell them something 
				I liked, something to work on, and then end saying overall I thought it was good. I didn’t want to offend 
				the other person or make them feel bad. However, I have learned that this is not beneficial 
				for either parties because the negative feedback gets lost. Reading these articles and listening to guest 
				speakers, I have learned a lot about the importance of constructive feedback and have started using 
				the tips from the articles in my everyday life.
				<br>
				<br>
				This semester, I became a project manager in one of my clubs. I was excited for the position
				because I would be leading a team for a project in the AI field which was something I was very interested in. 
				My team were all new hire consultants who had little experience with writing whitepapers, creating slides, 
				and conducting research, which meant I would need to be extra critical with revisions to make sure their 
				work was up to OTCR standards. I also would have to balance this negative feedback with the positive feedback 
				so they don't get discouraged. I thought back to times as a consultant that I would have liked to receive 
				feedback. I remembered what feedback was helpful and what feedback was just frustrating and used that to guide 
				my revisions.
				<br>
				<br>
				For example, I used to struggle a lot with slide designs. I was responsible for creating a slide for one of my 
				first workstreams and the PM didn’t like it very much so he scrapped it and gave me a new one to use. After that 
				week, I didn’t really have the chance to make a slide again because he made most of them, which was unfortunate 
				because I really wanted the chance to improve. This semester I noticed one of my consultants also having an issue 
				with slide design. Instead of just doing it myself, I set up a meeting with him to go over what I expected from a 
				slide, areas which were good, and areas where it could be improved. After two weeks of doing this, I saw a 
				significant improvement from his slides. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Another skill I use to struggle with as a consultant is presenting to the client. Before presentations I always
				made sure to have a script and I was always very nervous during calls. After my presentation was over, I would be 
				relieved but also not sure how I could improve moving forward. I asked my PM for feedback once or twice but he 
				always said I did a good job and we moved on. I remember wishing for tips or something to work on for the next 
				client call. I tried to keep that in mind this semester as a PM. During each client call, for every consultant I
				would write a few notes down and then send them individually to them after the call, making sure to keep in mind 
				what I learned from the article and not wrap the negative feedback with the positive. After about three weeks of 
				doing that, the consultants had made the changes and by the fourth week they had all done great and I had little 
				to no notes.
				<br>
				<br>
				Being a PM and a consultant in OTCR and reading the articles about feedback has shown me how valuable and important 
				it is to one’s growth. I hope as the semesters go on, I become more comfortable with asking for feedback and also 
				giving it.
