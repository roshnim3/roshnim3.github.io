   	<h1 class = "title">How I Learned To Give Constructive Feedback</h1>
	<p class = "blog">
		I am currently in a technology and management seminar where we get to meet and talk to leaders in the field and learn about how they got to where they are today. 
	One of my favorite weeks was about “how to give and receive constructive feedback,” which is something I struggled a lot with. Whenever I had to give feedback for 
	someone’s work or ideas, I always used a compliment sandwich. I would tell them something I liked, something to work on, and then end saying overall I thought it 
	was good. I used to do this because I didn’t want to offend the other person and I didn’t want to make them feel bad. But from the articles I learned that this was 
	not beneficial for the person because the negative feedback gets lost. Reading these articles and listening to guest speakers, I have learned a lot about the importance 
	of constructive feedback and have started using the tips from the articles in my everyday life. <br>
		This semester, I became a project manager in my consulting club, OTCR. I was excited for the position because I would be leading a team for a project in the AI field 
	which was something I was very interested in. My team were all new hire consultants who had little experience with writing whitepapers, creating slides, and conducting
	research. Before even starting the project I was told, I would have to be extra critical with revisions to make sure their work was up to OTCR standards. I was worried
	because I wanted to make sure I balanced the negative feedback with the positive feedback so as not to discourage them. I thought back to my semesters as a consultant and 
	thought about times I would have liked to receive feedback and what feedback was helpful and what feedback was just frustrating and used that to guide my revisions. <br>
		 For example, I used to struggle a lot with slide designs. I was responsible for creating a slide for one of my first workstreams and the PM didn’t like it very much 
	so he scrapped it and gave me a new one to use. After that week, I didn’t really have the chance to make a slide again because he made most of them, which was unfortunate 
	because I really wanted the chance to improve. This semester I noticed one of my consultants also having an issue with slide design. Instead of just doing it myself, I set up 
	a meeting with him to go over what I expected from a slide, areas which were good, and areas where it could be improved. After two weeks of doing this, I saw a significant 
	improvement from his slides. Now he is my go to slide design person. <br>
		Another skill I use to struggle with as a consultant is presenting to the client. Before presentations I always made sure to have a script and I was always very nervous 
	during calls. After my presentation was over, I would be relieved but also not sure how I could improve moving forward. I asked my PM for feedback once or twice but he always said 
	I did a good job and we moved on. I remember wishing for tips or something to work on for the next client call. I tried to keep that in mind this semester as a PM. During each 
	client call, for every consultant I would write a few notes down and then send them individually to them after the call, making sure to keep in mind what I learned from the article 
	and not wrap the negative feedback with the positive. After about three weeks of doing that, the consultants had made the changes and by the fourth week they had all done great and 
	I had little to no notes. <br>
		Being a PM and a consultant in OTCR and reading the articles about feedback has shown me how valuable and important it is to one’s growth. I hope as the semesters go on, \
	I become more comfortable with asking for feedback and also giving it.
