              <p>As a computer engineer specializing in neural engineering, I am deeply passionate about the intersection of technology and the human body. 
                I hope to help people with medical conditions like mine building devices that will improve their daily life.
                <br><br>
                Outside of school, I love to crochet from mini stuffed animals to sweaters. I also play the violin and am in a quartet for fun.
                I am also trying to build my fluency in Japanese. I studied the language and culture for four years in high school and am planning
                to continue my education in Japan this summer at the Hiroshima Institute of Technology. </p>
