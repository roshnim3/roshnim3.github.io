				<h1 class = "Title">Electronic Piano</h1>
				<h3 class = "Date">December 21, 2021</h3>
				<p> I built this electronic piano circuit using circuit designs online. As a musician, I was
					very excited to build it because I wanted to see how electric signals are
					converted to audio signals. 
					<br>
					<br>
					This circuit uses a 555 timer and plays a C-Major scale. My favorite part of making this circuit 
					was tuning each note. It took a little bit of trial and error for me to realize that the higher the 
					resistance the lower the note. Once I realized that, I used a guitar tuner app on my phone, and it 
					was a lot of trial and error until the note was in tune. I also learned the resistors had to be placed in series NOT in parallel. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Something I wanted to do was include sharps and flats but I ran out of buttons.
