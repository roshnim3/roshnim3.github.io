				<h1 class = "Title">REFLEX TIMER</h1>
				<h3 class = "Date">February 4, 2022</h3>
				<p> I built this reflex timer circuit using a circuit design out of the Make: Electronics book. 
					The purpose of the circuit is to time your reflexes. 
					<br>
					<br>
					There were two tricky parts to the circuit: 1) debugging the circuit was close to impossible because 
					there were so many wires and 2) I didn’t really understand how the circuit worked so that also made 
					debugging tricky. 
					<br>
					<br>
					To fix the first problem, I actually rebuilt the entire circuit using shorter wires 
					so you could easily see the connections (this has become my standard practice now, making sure to build 
					it as organized as possible). To fix the second problem, I spent hours researching every element in addition 
					to reading the book’s explanation. 
					<!-- Below, I compiled all of my research into an explanation of how this 
					circuit works well as how different chips work together. -->
